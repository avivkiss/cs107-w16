Getting Started
***************

Introduction
============
This section contains information on how to download the project from a
public Dropbox page. It also includes links to the downloads pages of
python and pycharm. Finally, it contains common commands that are used while
creating and running assignments.

Download Exercises 
==================
To download the exercises clone our repository with a `--recursive` flag: 

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:avivkiss/cs107-w16.git

Opening a project in Pycharm
============================
.. NOTE:: Pycharm must be installed on your computer before attempting to
   open a project in it.
   Click `here <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_ to
   download and install pycharm.

Pycharm allows you to open an existing project. To do this, navigate to the
top left corner and select File->open.

This will open a pop up window that you should use to navigate to the directory
that the project you wish to open is located in.

Run a sample assignment
=======================
.. WARNING:: Python must be installed on your computer in order to continue.
   Click `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ to install python.


From the terminal
-----------------
To run a sample assignment navigate to the cse207 directory and enter the
following command::
   python -m assignments.<assignment>

Do not add the .py at the end of the assignment name. Also note, this will
only work for Mac and Linux machines. Below is an example of how to run the
ind_cpa assignment::

    ~/Documents/cs107-w16 $ python -m assignments.<assignment>

    Your Decryption function is correct

From  Pycharm
-------------
After successfully downloading and opening the project, navigate to the
assignment that you wish to run. To do this, there is a directory tree on the
left hand side of the pycharm environment. Drill down into the assignments
directory and right click the assignment you wish to run.

A menu will appear with a list of options. Click on "run <assignment>" to
run an assignment or "Debug <assignment> to run the assignment in debugging
mode.

On the bottom panel a modified terminal will appear that will display
the output from the last assignment you ran. It is important to remember to
follow the above procedure every time you wish to run a different game.

Editing/Opening Assignments
===========================

From the terminal
-----------------
This is very similar to running an assignment, but instead of using the
python command replace it with the editor of your choice. Example opening
an assignment with vim::

    vim <assignment>

From pycharm
------------
As with running assignments in pycharm, you must first navigate to the right
directory in the document tree located in the left panel. Once you
locate the document you wish to edit, double click it. This will switch the
focus of the main panel to the source code of the document you are editing.

Creating Blank Assignments
==========================
From the terminal
-----------------
From the assignments directory, you can  create a new assignment with the
same command you use to edit an assignment. Here is an example using vim::

    vim <new assignment>

From pycharm
------------
Navigate to the correct directory from the directory tree in the left panel.
Right click on the assignments folder -> new.
